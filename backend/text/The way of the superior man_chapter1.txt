Stop Hoping for a Completion
of Anything in Life
Most men make the error of thinking that one day it will be done.
They think, "If I can work enough, then one day I could rest." Or,
"One day my woman will understand something and then she will
stop complaining." Or, "I'm only doing this now so that one day I can
do what I really want with my life" The masculine error is to think
that eventually things will be different in some fundamental way. They
won't. It never ends. As long as life continues, the creative challenge is to
tussle, play, and make love with the present moment while giving your
unique gift.
It's never going to be over, so stop waiting for the good stuff. As
of now, spend a minimum of one hour a day doing whatever you
are waiting to do until your finances are more secure, or until the
children have grown and left home, or until you have finished
your obligations and you feel free to do what you really want to
do. Don't wait any longer. Don't believe in the myth of "one day
31

--- Page 28 ---
THE WAY OF THE SUPERIOR MAN
when everything will be different." Do what you love to do,
what you are waiting to do, what you've been born to do, now.
Spend at least one hour a day doing whatever you simply love
to do—what you deeply feel you need to do, in your heart—in
spite of the daily duties that seem to constrain you. However, be
forewarned: you may discover that you don't, or can't, do it; that,
in fact, your fantasy of your future life is simply a fantasy.
Most postponements are excuses for a lack of creative disci-
pline. Limited money and family obligations have never stopped
a man who really wanted to do something, although they provide
excuses for a man who is not really up to the creative challenge
in the first place. Find out today whether you are willing to do
what it takes to give your gift fully. As a first step, spend at least
an hour today giving your fullest gift, whatever that is for today,
so that when you go to sleep at night you know you couldn't
have lived your day with more courage, creativity, and giving.
In addition to the myth that one day your life will be funda-
mentally different, you may believe, and hope, that one day your
woman will be fundamentally different. Don't wait. Assume she's
going to be however she is, forever. If your woman's behavior or
mood is truly intolerable to you, you should leave her, and don't
look back (since you cannot change her). However, if you find
her behavior or mood is merely distasteful or a hassle, realize that
she will always seem this way: The feminine always seems chaotic
and complicated from the perspective of the masculine.
The next time you notice yourself trying to fix your woman
so that she will no longer (fill in the blank),
4

--- Page 29 ---
A MAN'S WAY
relax and give her love by touching her and telling her that you
love her when she is this way (whatever you filled in the blank
with). Embrace her, or wrestle with her, or scream and yell for
the heck of it, but make no effort to bring an end to that which
pisses you off. Practice love instead of trying to bring an end to
the quality that bothers you. You can't escape the tussle with the
feminine. Learn to find humor in the unending emotional drama
the feminine seems to enjoy so much. The love that you magnify
may realign her behavior, but your effort to fix her and your frus-
tration never will.
The world and your woman will always present you with un-
foreseen challenges. You are either living fully, giving your gift in
the midst of those challenges, even today, or you are waiting for
an imaginary future which will never come. Men who have lived
significant lives are men who never waited: not for money, secu-
rity, ease, or women. Feel what you want to give most as a gift,
to your woman and to the world, and do what you can to give it
today. Every moment waited is a moment wasted, and each
wasted moment degrades your clarity of purpose.

Closing down in the midst of pain is a denial of a man's true nature. A
superior man is free in feeling and action, even amidst great pain and
hurt. If necessary, a man should live with a hurting heart rather than a
closed one. He should learn to stay in the wound of pain and act with
spontaneous skill and love even from that place.
Imagine failing at a major project, lying to your woman and get-
ting caught, or overhearing her joke about your shortcomings in
bed. How do you react with your body, breath, and eyes? Notice
if you react to a person or situation that hurts you by withdraw-
ing, hiding, or closing in on yourself. Notice if there are times
when you find it difficult to look into someone's eyes, or times
when your chest and solar plexus become tense and contracted.
These are signs of an unskillful reaction to hurt. Contracted and
closed in on yourself, you are unable to act. You are trapped in
your own self-protective tension, no longer a free man.
62
Live With an Open Heart
Even If It Hurts

--- Page 31 ---
A MAN'S WAY
The superior man practices opening during these times of
automatic closure. Open the front of your body so your chest and
solar plexus are not tense. Sit or stand up straight and full, open-
ing the front of your body, softening your chest and belly, wide
and free. Breathe down through your chest and solar plexus, deep
into your belly. Look directly into the eyes of whomever you are
with, feeling your own pain as well as feeling the other person.
Only when the front of your body is relaxed and opened, your
breath full and deep, and your gaze unguarded and directly con-
nected with another person's eyes, can your fullest intelligence
manifest spontaneously in the situation. To act as a superior man,
a samurai of relationship, you must feel the entire situation with
your whole body. A closed body is unable to sense subtle cues
and signals, and therefore unable to act with mastery in the situ-
ation.

Live As If Your Father Were Dead
A man must love his father and yet be free of his father's expectations
and criticisms in order to be a free man.
Imagine that your father has died, or remember when he did die.
Are there any feelings of relief associated with his death? Now
that he is dead, is any part of you happy that you need not live up
to his expectations or suffer his criticisms?
How would you have lived your life differently if you had
never tried to please your father? If you never tried to show your
father that you were worthy? If you never felt burdened by your
father's critical eye?
For the next three days, do at least one activity a day that you
have avoided or suppressed because of the influence of your
father. In this way, practice being free of his subtle expectations,
which may now reside within your own self-judgment. Practice
being free in this way, once each day for three days, even if you
still feel fearful, limited, unworthy, or burdened by your father's
expectations.

It is honorable for a man to admit his fears, resistance, and edge of prac-
tice. It is simply true that each man has his limit, his capacity for
growth, and his destiny. But it is dishonorable for him to lie to himself
or others about his real place. He shouldn't pretend he is more enlight-
ened than he is—nor should he stop short of his actual edge. The more
a man is playing his real edge, the more valuable he is as good company
for other men, the more he can be trusted to be authentic and fully pre-
sent. Where a man's edge is located is less important than whether he is
actually living his edge in truth, rather than being lazy or deluded.
Pick an area of your life, perhaps your intimate relationship, your
career, your relationship with your children, or your spiritual
practice. For instance, you are currently doing something to earn
a living. Where do your fears stop you from making a larger con-
tribution to mankind, from earning a higher income, or from
earning money in a more creative and enjoyable way? If you
were absolutely fearless, would you be earning a living in exactly
9Know Your Real Edge
and Don't Fake it

--- Page 34 ---
the same way as you are now? Your edge is where you stop short,
or where you compromise your fullest gift, and, instead, cater to
your fears.
Have you lost touch with the fears that are limiting and shap-
ing your income and style of livelihood? If you have deluded
yourself and feel that you are not afraid, then you are lying to
yourself. All men are afraid, unless they are perfectly free. If you
cannot admit this, you are pretending to yourself, and to others.
Your friends will feel your fear, even if you do not. Thus, they
will lose trust in you, knowing you are deluding yourself, lying
to yourself, and are therefore likely to lie to them, consciously or
unconsciously.
Or, perhaps you are very aware of your fears: your fear to take
risks, your fear of failing, or your fear of succeeding. Perhaps you
are comfortable with your life, and you fear the lifestyle change
that might accompany a change in career, even though the new
career will be closer to what you really want to do with your life.
Some men fear the feeling of fear and therefore don't even ap-
proach their edge. They choose a job they know they can do well
and easily, and don't even approach the fullest giving of their gift.
Their lives are relatively secure and comfortable, but dead. They
lack the aliveness, the depth, and the inspirational energy that is
the sign of a man living at his edge. If you are this kind of man
who is hanging back, working hard perhaps, but not at your real
edge, other men will not be able to trust that you can and will
help them live at their edge and give their fullest gift.
10THE WAY OF THE SUPERIOR MAN

--- Page 35 ---
A MAN'S WAY
As an experiment, describe your edge with respect to your
career out loud to yourself. Say something like, "I know I could
be earning more money, but I am too lazy to put in the extra
hours it would take. I know that I could give more of my true
gift, but I am afraid that I may not succeed, and then I will be a
penniless failure. I've spent 15 years developing my career, and
I'm afraid to let go of it and start fresh, even though I know that
I spend most of my life doing things I have no real interest in
doing. I could be making money in more creative ways, but I
spend too much time watching TV rather than being creative."
Honor your edge. Honor your choices. Be honest with your-
self about them. Be honest with your friends about them. A fear-
ful man who knows he is fearful is far more trustable than a
fearful man who isn't aware of his fear. And a fearful man who
still leans into his fear, living at his edge and putting his gift out
from there, is more trustworthy and more inspirational than a
fearful man who hangs back in the comfort zone, unwilling to
even experience his fear on a day to day level. A free man is free
to acknowledge his fears, without hiding them, or hiding from
them. Live with your lips pressed against your fears, kissing your
fears, neither pulling back nor aggressively violating them.

Eternity must be a man's home, moment by moment. Without it, he is
lost, always striving, grasping at puffs of smoke. A man must do any-
thing necessary to glimpse, and then stabilize, this ever-fresh
realization, and organize his life around it.
Make your life an ongoing process of being who you are, at your
deepest, most easeful levels of being. Everything other than this
process is secondary. Your job, your children, your wife, your
money, your artistic creations, your pleasures—they are all super-
ficial and empty, if they are not floating in the deep sea of your
conscious being. How many hours today was your attention fo-
cused in the realm of changes—on events, people, thoughts, and
experiences—and how often was your attention relaxed into its
source? Where is your attention right now? Can you feel its
source? Even for a moment, can you feel that which makes at-
tention conscious and aware? Can you feel the deepest nature of
12Always Hold To
Your Deepest Realization

--- Page 37 ---
A MAN'S WAY
attention? What happens when you simply, effortlessly, allow at-
tention to subside into its source?
This source is never changing and always present. It is the
constant, silent tone behind and pervading the music of life. Feel
into this source as deeply as possible, and then re-approach your
work, intimacy, family, and creative efforts. When you make love,
make love from this source. When you make money, make
money from this source. Find out what happens to the details of
your life when you live more consistently from this source.
Use aids to support your relaxation into, and creation from,
this source. Read books that remind you of who you are, in
truth. Spend time with people who inspire you and reflect the
source to you. Meditate, contemplate, or pray daily so that you
steep yourself in the source.
If you are like most men, you have strong habits that rivet
your attention to the events and tasks of the day. Days and nights
fly by for years, and life slips through your fingers, your attention
absorbed in the seeming world of necessary responsibilities. But
all of it is empty if we do not live our responsibilities as expres-
sions of our depth of being and heart-truth.
Know eternity. Do whatever it takes. And from this depth of
being, live the details of your life. But if you postpone the process
of submerging yourself in the source for the sake of taking care
of business first, your life will be spent in hours and days of busi-
ness, and then it will be gone. Only if you are well grounded in
that which is larger than this life will you be able to play life with
humor, knowing that each task is but a mirage of necessity.
13

--- Page 38 ---
Even if you find yourself in some trivial moment, watching
TV or cleaning up a mess in the kitchen, feel the truth of who
you are. Feel the boundless cognizance in which each instant
seems and vanishes. All moments are the same intensity of clar-
ity, completeness, and humor when you meet each moment with
your deepest realization. Nothing that has ever happened has
made any difference to the One who you are.
14THE WAY OF THE SUPERIOR MAN

--- Page 39 ---
If a woman suggests something that changes a man's perspective, then
he should make a new decision based on his new perspective. But he
should never betray his own deepest knowledge and intuition in order to
please his woman or "go along" with her. Both she and he will be
weakened by such an action. They will grow to resent each other, and
the crust of accumulated inauthenticity will burden their love, as well as
their capacity for free action.
You should always listen to your woman, and then make your
own decision. If you choose to go with your woman's suggestion
even when deep in your heart you feel that another decision is
more wise, you are, in effect, saying, "I don't trust my own
wisdom." You are weakening yourself by telling yourself this. You
are weakening your woman's trust in you: why should she trust
your wisdom if you don't?
When you deny your deep truth to please your woman,
everyone will feel your lack of authenticity. They will sense that
156
Never Change Your Mind
Just to Please a Woman

--- Page 40 ---
your false smile hides an inner division. Your friends, children,
and business colleagues may love you, but they won't trust you,
since you don't trust your own core intent. And, more impor-
tantly, your own sense of inauthenticity will burden your capac-
ity to act with clarity. Your actions won't jibe with your core.
However, if you listen to your woman, taking everything she
says into account and making your own best decision, then you
are acting in accordance with your core. You are saying, in effect,
"My deepest wisdom is leading me to this decision. If I am
wrong, I will learn from it, and my wisdom will have deepened.
I'm willing to be wrong, and grow from it. I trust this process of
acting from my deepest wisdom."
This attitude of self-trust engenders others' trust in you. You
may be wrong, but you are willing to find out, and thus grow
from the experience. You are open to listening to others, but in
the end, you will take the responsibility for making your own de-
cision. There is nobody else to blame.
However, if you give up your real decision to follow your
woman's, then you will blame her for being wrong if she is
wrong, and you will feel disempowered if she is right, having
denied yourself the opportunity to act from your core and grow
from your mistakes. Be open to changing your feeling based on
whatever your woman might reveal to you—through her words
or her body language—and then make your own decision, based
on your deepest intuitive wisdom and knowledge. You may make
the right decision or the wrong one, but whatever happens, it is
16THE WAY OF THE SUPERIOR MAN

your best shot, and you will strengthen your capacity for future
action.
17

Every man knows that his highest purpose in life cannot be reduced to
any particular relationship. If a man prioritizes his relationship over his
highest purpose, he weakens himself disserves the universe, and cheats his
woman of an authentic man who can offer her full, undivided presence.
Admit to yourself that if you had to choose one or the other, the
perfect intimate relationship or achieving your highest purpose
in life, you would choose to succeed at your purpose. Just this
self-knowledge often relieves much pressure a man feels to pri-
oritize his relationship when, in fact, it is not his highest priority.
Your mission is your priority. Unless you know your mission
and have aligned your life to it, your core will feel empty. Your
presence in the world will be weakened, as will your presence
with your intimate partner. The next time you notice yourself
"giving in" to your woman, postponing your mission and deny-
ing your true purpose in order to spend time with her, stop. Tell
your woman that you love her, but you cannot deny your heart's
18Your Purpose Must Come
Before Your Relationship

--- Page 43 ---
A MAN'S WAY
purpose. Tell her that you will spend 30 minutes (or some specific
time) with her in absolute attention and total presence, but then
you must return to carry on your mission.
Your woman will be more fulfilled with 30 minutes a day of
undivided attention and ravishing love than she will with a few
hours of your weak and divided presence when your heart really
isn't into it. Time you spend with your woman should be time
you really want to be with her more than anything else. If you'd
rather be doing something else, she'll feel it. Both of you will be
dissatisfied.
19

Lean Just Beyond Your Edge
In any given moment, a man's growth is optimized if he leans just
beyond his edge, his capacity, his fear. He should not be too lazy, hap-
pily stagnating in the zone of security and comfort. Nor should he push
far beyond his edge, stressing himself unnecessarily, unable to metabolize
his experience. He should lean just slightly beyond the edge of fear and
discomfort. Constantly. In everything he does.
Once you are honest with yourself about your real edge, it is best
to lean just beyond it. Very few men have the guts for this prac-
tice. Most men either settle for the easy path or self-aggrandize
themselves by taking the extreme hard path. Your insecurity may
cause you to doubt yourself, and so you take the easy way, not
even approaching your real edge or your real gift. Alternatively,
your insecurity may lead you to push, push, push, seeking to
become victorious over your own sense of lack.
Both approaches avoid your actual condition in the moment,
which is often fear. If you are stressfully avoiding your fear, you
cannot relax into the fearless.
20

--- Page 45 ---
A MAN'S WAY
Your fear is the sharpest definition of your self. You should
know it. You should feel it virtually constantly. Fear needs to
become your friend, so that you are no longer uncomfortable
with it. Rather, primary fear shows you that you are at your edge.
Staying with the fear, staying at your edge, allows real transfor-
mation to occur. Neither lazy nor aggressive, playing your edge
allows you to perceive the moment with the least amount of dis-
tortion. You are willing to be with what is, rather than trying to
escape it by pulling back from it, or trying to escape it by push-
ing beyond it into some future goal.
Fear of fear may lead you to hang back, living a lesser life
than you are capable. Fear of fear may lead you to push ahead,
living a false life, off center, tense and missing the moment. But
the capacity to feel this moment, including your fear, without
trying to escape it, creates a state of alive and humble spontane-
ity. You are ready for the unknown as it unfolds, since you are not
pulled back or pushed forward from the horizon of the moment.
You are hanging right over the edge.
By leaning just beyond your fear, you challenge your limits
compassionately, without trying to escape the feeling of fear
itself. You step beyond the solid ground of security with an open
heart. You stand in the space of unknowingness, raw and awake.
Here, the gravity of deep being will attend you to the only place
where fear is obsolete: the eternal free fall of home. Where you
always are.
Own your fear, and lean just beyond it. In every aspect of
your life. Starting now.
21

Do It for Love
The way a man penetrates the world should be the same way he
penetrates his woman: not merely for personal gain or pleasure, but to
magnify love, openness, and depth.
The next time you embrace your woman sexually, feel your ulti-
mate desire. Your deepest desire in life. Feel why you are doing
anything at all in life, and, specifically, why you are uniting with
your lover. There may be many lesser reasons, but what is your
deepest, ultimate reason?
Most men's ultimate reason for doing anything has to do with
discovering their deepest truth, enjoying total freedom and love,
and giving their fullest gifts.
Yet, many men settle for enjoying a little bit of freedom and
love while incompletely giving their gifts. They enjoy the free-
dom to buy a nice car, to have loving sex fairly often, and to sleep
late on Sunday. They generously donate their spare cash to a good
cause, lovingly buy their woman a diamond ring, and happily
coach a little league team. These are enjoyable freedoms and real
229

--- Page 47 ---
A MAN'S WAY
gifts that make a significant difference in people's lives. But, for
many men, it is still not enough.
The freedom or love they have achieved and the way they
have given their gifts often leave a sense of incompleteness.
Something is still lacking. There is still a desire to go beyond, to
untrap themselves, to enjoy life free of a subtle sense of con-
straint, loneliness, underlying tension, and fear. And, for many
men, try as they might, the sense remains that their fullest gift re-
mains ungiven. Their life feels somewhat false at its core, as does
their sexing.
When a man gives his true gift of sex to his woman, he pen-
etrates and blooms her beyond all limits into love. It is the same
with the world. To bloom woman and world for real takes au-
thenticity, persistence, and courage of heart. A man must know
the truth at his core and be willing to give his gifts fully. No
holding back. He must be willing to dedicate his sex and his life
to magnifying love by penetrating woman and world with his
true gifts. This willingness is rare.
Many men are willing to poke their woman and bloom her
in a mediocre way, sharing a few orgasms and a few emotional
moments of bonding before going over tomorrow's schedule.
Many men are willing to poke the world and bloom it in a
mediocre way, making a few bucks and contributing enough bet-
terment so they don't feel like their life is a total waste.
But very few men are willing to do the deed for real, to use
everything they've got to liberate their woman and the world
into the deepest possible truth, love, and openness. Few men are
23

--- Page 48 ---
willing to give their deepest genius, their true endowment, the
poetry of their very being, with every thrust of sex and life. Most
men are limpened with doubts and uncertainties. Or they hold
back their true drive because of fear. So they diddle their woman
and the world just enough to extract the pleasure and comfort
they need to assuage their nagging sense of falsity and incom-
pleteness.
But if you are willing to discover and embrace your truth,
lean through your fears, and give everything you've got, you can
penetrate the world and your woman from the core of your
being and bloom them into love without limit. You can ravish
your woman so deeply that her surrender breaks your heart into
light. You can press yourself into the world with such enduring
love that the world opens and receives your deepest gifts.
There is no essential difference between entering your
woman's feminine heart and entering fully into the world. Both
forms of intercourse, sexual and worldly, require sensitivity, spon-
taneity, and a strong connection to deep truth in order to pene-
trate chaos and closure in a way that love prevails.
Neither woman nor world are predictable. They will often
seem to resist your gifts and test your capacity to persist. And, just
as surely, they will tenderly respond to the authenticity of your
relaxed ministrations, the freedom expressed in your humor, and
the invasion of your adamant love. They will open in love and re-
ceive you fully—only to resist and test you again, moments or
days later. Neither woman nor world can be second-guessed, or
24THE WAY OF THE SUPERIOR MAN

--- Page 49 ---
fooled. They know when you are just clicking around. They want
to receive you for real.
There are two ways to deal with woman and world without
compromising your true gifts or dribbling away the force of your
deep being. One way is to renounce sexual intimacy and world-
liness, totally dedicating yourself without distraction or compro-
mise to the path you choose to pursue, free of the seemingly
constant demands of woman and world.
The other way is to "fuck" both to smithereens, to ravish
them with your love unsheathed, to give your true gifts despite
the constant tussle of woman and world, to smelt your authentic
gifts in this friction of opposition and surrender, to thrust love
from the freedom of your deep being even as your body and
mind die blissfully through a crucifixion of inevitable pleasure
and pain, attraction and repulsion, gain and loss. No gifts left un-
given. No limit to the depth of being. Only openness, freedom,
and love as the legacy of your intercourse with woman and
world.
If you are going to tryst with woman and world at all, better
to go all the way and ravish them from the depths of your true
core, blooming them open with the wide gifts of your unrelent-
ing heart. Otherwise, if you sheepishly penetrate them to gratify
your own needs, your woman and the world will feel your lack
of dedication, depth, and truth. Rather than yielding in love to
your loving, they will distract you, suck your energy, and draw
you into endless complications, so that your life and relationship
become an almost constant search for release from constraint.
25A MAN'S WAY

--- Page 50 ---
You can be a renunciate and live alone, apart from woman
and world. But if you choose a life of sexual and worldly inter-
course, you will feel trapped by woman and world unless you are
free in the midst of "true fuck," yielding yourself into the giving,
holding nothing back, dissolving all time in the open of love.
Through thick and thin, this is the way of the superior man.
