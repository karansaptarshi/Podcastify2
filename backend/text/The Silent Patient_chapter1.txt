PART ONE
He that has eyes to see and ears to hear may
convince himself that no mortal can keep a secret.
If his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips;
betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.

CHAPTER ONE
ALICIA BERENSON W AS THIR TY-THREE YEARS OLD  when she killed her husband.
They had been married for seven years. They were both artists—Alicia
was a painter , and Gabriel was a well-known fashion photograp her. He had
a distinctive style, shooting semi-starved, semi-naked women in strange,
unflattering angles. Since his death, the price of his photographs has
increased astronomically . I find his stuff rather slick and shallow, to be
honest. It has none of the visceral quality of Alicia’ s best work. I don’t
know enough about art to say whether Alicia Berenson will stand the test of
time as a painter . Her talent will always be overshadowed by her notoriety ,
so it’s hard to be objective. And you might well accuse me of being biased.
All I can offer is my opinion, for what it’s worth. And to me, Alicia was a
kind of genius. Apart from her technical skill, her paintings have an
uncanny ability to grab your attention—by the throat, almost— and hold it
in a viselike grip.
Gabriel Berenson was murdered  six years ago. He was forty-four years
old. He was killed on the twenty-fifth of August—it was an unusually hot
summer , you may remember , with some of the highest temperatures ever
recorded. The day he died was the hottest of the year .
On the last day of his life, Gabriel rose early . A car collected him at 5:15
a.m. from  the house he shared with Alicia in northwest London,  on the edge
of Hampstead Heath, and he was driven to a shoot in Shoreditch. He spent
the day photographing models on a rooftop for V ogue.
Not much is known about Alicia’s movements. She had an upcoming
exhibition and was behind with her work. It’s likely she spent the day
painting in the summerhouse at the end of the garden, which she had

--- Page 11 ---
recently converted into a studio. In the end, Gabriel’ s shoot ran late, and he
wasn’ t driven home until eleven p.m.
Half an hour later, their neighbor , Barbie Hellmann, heard several
gunshots. Barbi e phoned the police, and a car was dispatched from the
station on Haverstock Hill at 11:35 p.m. It arrived at the Berensons’ house
in just under three minutes.
The front door was open. The house was in pitch-black darkne ss; none
of the light switc hes worked. The officers made their way along the hallway
and into the living room. They shone torches around the room, illuminating
it in intermittent beams of light. Alicia was discovered standing by the
fireplace. Her white dress glowe d ghostlike in the torchlight. Alicia seemed
oblivious to the presence of the police. She was immobilized, frozen—a
statue carved from ice—with a strange, frightened look on her face, as if
confronting some unseen terror .
A gun was on the floor . Next to it, in the shadows, Gabriel was seated,
motionless, bound to a chair with wire wrapped around his ankles and
wrists. At first the officers thought he was alive. His head lolled slightly to
one side, as if he were unconscious. Then a beam of light revea led Gabriel
had been  shot several times in the face. His handsome features were gone
forever , leaving a charred, blackened, bloody mess. The wall behind him
was sprayed with fragments of skull, brains, hair—and blood.
Blood was everywhere—splashed on the walls, running in dark rivulets
along the floor , along the grain  of the wooden floorboards. The officers
assumed it was Gabriel’ s blood. But there was too much of it. And then
something glinted in the torchlight—a knife was on the floor  by Alicia’ s
feet. Another beam of light revealed the blood spattered on Alicia’ s white
dress. An officer grabbed her arms and held them up to the light. There
were deep cuts across the veins in her wrists—fresh cuts, bleeding hard.
Alicia fought off the attempts to save her life; it took three officers to
restrain her. She was taken to the Royal Free Hospital, only a few minutes
away . She collap sed and lost consciousness on the way there. She had lost a
lot of blood, but she survived.
The following day, she lay in bed in a private room at the hospital. The
police questioned her in the presence of her lawyer . Alicia remained silent

--- Page 12 ---
throughout the interview . Her lips were pale, bloodless; they fluttered
occasionally but formed no words, made no sounds. She answered no
questions. She could not, would not, speak. Nor did she speak when
charged with Gabriel’ s murder . She remained silent when she was placed
under arrest, refusing to deny her guilt or confess it.
Alicia never spoke again.
Her enduring silence turned this story from a commonplace domestic
tragedy into something far grander: a mystery , an enigma that gripped the
headlines and captured the public imagination for months to come.
Alicia remained silent—but she made one statement. A painting. It was
begun when she was dischar ged from the hospital and placed under house
arrest before the trial. According to the court-appointed psychiatric nurse,
Alicia barely ate or slept—all she did was paint.
Normally Alicia  labored weeks, even months, before embarking on a
new picture, making endless sketches, arranging and rearranging the
composition, experimenting with color and form—a long gestation
followed by a protracted birth  as each brushstroke was painstakingly
applied. Now , however , she drastically altered her creative process,
completing this painting within a few days of her husband’ s murder .
And for most people, this was enough to condemn her—returning to the
studio so soon after Gabriel’ s death betrayed an extraordinary insensitivity .
The monstrous lack of remorse of a cold-blooded killer .
Perhaps. But let us not forget that while Alicia Berenson may be a
murderer , she was also an artist. It makes perfect sense—to me at least—
that she should pick up her brushes and paints and express her complicated
emotions on canvas. No wonde r that, for once, painting came to her with
such ease; if grief can be called easy .
The painting was a self-portrait. She titled it in the bottom left-hand
corner of the canvas, in light blue Greek lettering.
One word:
Alcestis.
